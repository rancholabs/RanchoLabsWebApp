All this has been possible due to the wonderful guidance of the zealous instructors. I am really very thankful to the entire team for providing me this wonderful opportunity of learning about Robotics.",

        "description": "My experience with Rancho Labs has been great so far! The fact that they are providing courses to students with no prior experience at such nominal fee amazes me. They pay close attention to each student with small batches and donâ€™t move a step forward until the doubts of every student has been cleared. I would highly recommend others to enroll with them as soon as possible!",

        "description": "Although learning how to build robots, circuits and innovative projects seems like a hands-on activity, the amazing team at Rancho Labs has managed to achieve this feat on a virtual platform as well. Over the course of a month, I have gained a vast amount of knowledge in this field, and the projects that we have to make have really fascinated me. The best part of Rancho Labs is that they prepare you for the present as well as the future.",

Finally, I would say that I found the course very interesting and I would look forward to joining courses like these in future.",

The claases were well planned and executed and the instructors were available round the clock to clarify doubts.  Hands on projects in stimulated environments helped students to reinforce concepts learned every day. I am happy to have enrolled my son in this course,  as it has given a solid foundation to 'future proof' his skill sets.",
